# School-Projects-Public-
A collection of my programming projects as a student at the University of Michigan. 
Due to concerns with the University of Michigan Honor Code (http://ecas.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2019/03/Honor-Code-Pamphlet-2018.pdf), my projects are not public. If you would like to be added to my private repository and view my projects, please contact me at arshpatel2001@gmail.com.
